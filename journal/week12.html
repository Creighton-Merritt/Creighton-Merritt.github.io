                <p>This week I am working on my local storage project. I'm getting the saving of data finished first, then I'll
                    make the UI more pleasing to the eye and easy to use. It took me a while to figure out how to display the 
                    table without duplicates. It shouldn't have taken that long, as it was a simple solution, but it did. It was one
                    of those mistakes that was super simple, but I missed it because I was looking somewhere else for the mistake.
