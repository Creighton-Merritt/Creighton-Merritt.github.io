                <p>I learned something new and pretty cool this week. As I was following along with Bro. Thayne's video demonstrating 
                    DOM manipulation, I kept getting the error "Cannot read property 'appendChild' of null". I was doing the exact same thing as Bro.
                    Thayne, so I was pretty confused. But I found the answer on stack overflow. Since I have the script tag above the 
                    html body, the JavaScript tries to execute before the rest of the page loads, so there is no table to add to. That
                    is when I learned that you can add 'defer' to the script tag, so that the JavaScript loads later.
