                <p>12/9 - This week I am finishing up my final project. I still need to add a delete feature so I can edit the list. I also
                    need to add some animations and more css to make the style look better. 
                </p><br>
                <p>12/11 - I think I've finished my project, but I'll need to test it a few more times to make sure. I actually learned a lot 
                    about jQuery for this assignment, which is something I have always struggled with. So that is pretty great!
